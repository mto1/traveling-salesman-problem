Work

The traveling salesman problem consists of a salesman and a set of cities. The salesman
has to visit each one of the cities starting from a certain one (e.g. the hometown) and
returning to the same city.
The challenge of the problem is that the traveling salesman wants to minimize the total
length of the trip.

To do

We found in file named cites.txt a geographic latitude and longitude of center of few
cities of the world.
We assume that : the edge exists between two cities if and only if the distance between
the cities is greater than 100KM.

— Read data from the file.
— Load it in data structure representing the graph.

1. Find the maximum length path of the trip of traveling salesman problem starting
from "PARIS" and visits each city exactly once and returning to "PARIS.
(a) using an exact method to find an exact solution
(b) using Lin-Kernighan heuristic
(c) using Local search heuristic.

2. Implement an algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. This spanning tree
must contain the edge "PARIS —> SAINT GEORGES"
